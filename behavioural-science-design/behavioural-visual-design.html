<p class="p-feature">Behavioural Design is a systematic understanding of how people think and how they make decisions. This understanding forms the basis of thinking about interventions that lead to behavioural change. </p>
<p class="p-feature">Maybe you want to influence the behaviour of your partner or children. You might want to influence your colleagues or managers. Some people like to develop a healthy habit for themselves or want to live a more sustainable life. Maybe you want to influence customer behaviour or win elections. No matter what the subject is, you can all think of them as a behavioural design challenge.</p>

    <h2>Why is Visual Design So Important?</h2>
<p>We have a lot of our brain dedicated to vision, and because of that, we find vision quite easy. We should promote visual layouts where possible as we <b>process visuals 60,000 times faster than text</b>.</p> 
<ul class="ul-ticked">
    <li>50% of your cortex is involved in Visual Processing</li>
    <li>70% of all your sensory receptors are in your eyes</li>
    <li>We can get a sense of a scene in less than 1/10th of a second</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, because we find it quite easy, we tend to rely heavily on visual information given to us through our visual system. This explains the picture superiority bias: we find it easy to process images over text. </p>
  <p>This reliance means that we’re prone to cognitive biases, and there are lots of cognitive biases that are specific to the visual system. These biases go one step further than just being tricked by a few words: There’s all sorts of contrast and orientation that can trick you too.</p>

<h3 slot="heading">Visual cues</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>The Homer part of your brain reacts much faster than conscious thought and is triggered anytime we’re exposed to a representation of food, shelter, danger or reproduction.</p> 
<p>These reactions are called “visceral reactions” as they originate from the Central Nervous System.</p>
<p>An <b>example of using visual cues is the Apple Store</b>. They present 3 initial options, with reduced amounts of information but still giving you the choice to find out more. They’ve made a real effort to reduce the visual complexity, whilst still giving you that mobility of choice.</p>

<h3 slot="heading">Visceral Reactions</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>These are the same reactions that occur when we are presented with new stimuli, such as a website or letter.</p>
<p>For instance, on a website, the colour, the images, and the text is all going to be targeting your Homer brain, and because of that you’re going to be able to <b>make a very quick decision of whether you like it or not</b>.</p>

<h3 slot="heading">Thin-Slicing</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>A term to describe the ability to find patterns in events based only on "thin slices," or narrow windows, of experience.</p>
<p>The term means making very quick inferences about the state, characteristics or details of an individual or situation with minimal amounts of information.</p>
<p>When looking at a website, the element that you would have subconsciously considered the most was the visual complexity.</p>

<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard" decoration="laptop">
<h3 slot="heading">Visual Complexity</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Visual complexity leads to Cognitive Overload. if we’re receiving too much visual input at once, it’s going to overload us, and so we feel unable to make a good decision.</p>
<p>When we are faced with too much information, we are forced to undergo a Cost-Benefit Analysis:</p>
<p>“Is the perceived difficulty of the task less than the expected reward?” or “is it worth me reaching the end of this journey?”</p>

<h2>Gestalt Principle</h2>
<p>We like to see groups and patterns where they don’t necessarily exist. Elements grouped in close proximity are seen as related.</p>
<p>In terms of reducing the visual complexity, when you’ve got a higher number of things, it’s about chunking them into groups, and using the space in a clever way so you aren’t overloading the customer, and this means that they’re able to handle more options than they may have been able to previously.</p> 
<p>e.g. In business we can use patterns to make guesses around where people are going to look, for example on a website or letter, and this will allow us to better place information from a Behavioural Design perspective, so they’re more likely to attend to the information we want them to.</p>

<h2>How Can Facial Recognition Help Us?</h2>
<p>It has been speculated that since practice makes perfect, we have just become really good at recognising faces.</p>
<p>However, experts in facial recognition have found that we actually have cells in our brain specifically dedicated to encoding faces.</p> 
<p>Not only do faces attract our attention, but they can also tell us how to feel.</p> <p>When a person sees another person smile, they will simulate the smile too in the form of a micro-expression. This applies to many other expressions such as frowning or disgust.</p>
