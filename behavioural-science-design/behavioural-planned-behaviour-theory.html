<div slot="paragraph">
<p>The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is a well-known model that has been widely used in the past, in part due to its relative simplicity and ease of use. The theory was elaborated by Icek Ajzen for the purpose of improving the predictive power of the theory of reasoned action, predicting how individuals will behave based on their pre-existing attitudes and behavioural intentions.</p>
<p>The theory maintains that <b>three core components, namely, attitude, subjective norms</b>, and <b>perceived behavioural control</b>, together shape an individual's behavioural intentions.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The theory proposes that an individual's behaviour is <b>influenced by three factors: their attitude toward the behaviour, subjective norms</b>, and <b>perceived behavioural control</b>. These elements collectively shape a person’s intentions and actions.</p> 
<p>Intention is considered a direct predictor of behaviour. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is an enhanced version of the expectancy-value model. While the expectancy-value model focuses solely on attitude, the TPB also incorporates the concept of subjective norms—how socially acceptable an individual believes their behaviour is.</p>
<p>Additionally, it includes perceived behavioural control, which refers to how easy or difficult an individual perceives performing a certain behaviour to be.</p>

<h2>The value of using this model</h2>

<ns-alert type="highlighter" state="success">
  <h2 slot="heading">Strengths</h2>
  <ul class="ul-ticked">
    <li>An individual's behavioural intention can’t be the exclusive determinant of behaviour where an individual's control over the behaviour is not considered. By adding "perceived behavioural control," the Theory of Planned Behaviour can explain the relationship between behavioural intention and actual behaviour</li>
    <li>The TPB has improved the predictability of intention in various health-related fields such as condom use, leisure, exercise, diet, etc</li>
    <li>Explains the importance of social behaviour by considering "social norm" as an important variable</li>
  </ul>
</ns-alert>
<ns-alert>
  <h2 slot="heading">Limitations</h2>
  <ul class="ul-crossed">
    <li>Some have criticised the theory on the basis of ignoring a person’s needs prior to engaging in a certain action, needs that would affect his behaviour regardless of his expressed attitudes</li>
    <li>Sometimes beliefs are found to predict behaviour over and above intentions</li>
    <li>Factors such as self-determination, identity, planning and habit strength have also been found to predict behaviour above intention</li>
    <li>Changes to the choice architecture can change behaviour outside of an individual’s awareness without impacting intention.</li>
