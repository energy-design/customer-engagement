<h1>The MINDSPACE Framework</h1>
<p class="p-feature">MINDSPACE is a framework from the Institute for Government to support Behavioural Scientists. It highlights nine important factors that drive all behaviour, <b>messenger (M), incentives (I), norms (N), defaults (D), salience (S), priming (P), affect (A), commitments (C)</b>, and <b>ego (E)</b>.</p>

<h2>Messenger</h2>
<p>Our responses to information are strongly affected by the messenger</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Authority</b> – If the messenger is an expert, people are more likely to respond to their message. This authority is enhanced if the expert is demographically and behaviourally similar to the recipient</li>
   <li><b>Peer Effects</b> – We are more likely to act when we receive information from peers.</li>

<h2>Incentives</h2>
<p>Our responses to information are strongly affected by the messenger</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Loss Aversion</b> – people are more likely to act when the choice architecture emphasises what they will lose by not acting</li>
   <li><b>Incentives are Relative</b> – People judge incentives using reference points, so sometimes seemingly small changes in value can have a large impact</li>
   <li><b>People place more weight on small probabilities</b> – Rational economic theory would suggest that a change in probability from 5% to 10% would be treated the same as a change from 65% to 70%. However, research suggests that this is not the case, and that we place more emphasis on small probabilities than we should (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984)</li>
   <li><b>Mental Accounting</b> – we tend to place money into different budgets in our heads, such as savings, credit card payments, holiday fund, etc. How much money we have in these “mental money pots” will restrict our spending on those items</li>
   <li><b>Present Bias</b> – We typically like to receive a smaller, instant reward rather than a larger payoff that we have to wait for.</li>

<h2>Norms</h2>
<p>We typically behave in the way we see others around us behave</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Share desirable norms</b> – If most people are behaving in the right way, tell everyone about this. Others will use the behaviour of others to guide their actions, which means positive behaviour can spread quickly</li>
   <li><b>Connect the norm to your target audience</b> – make sure the norm is localised to the individual, so that they are more likely to comply</li>
   <li><b>Take advantage of social networks</b> – Use social norms and networks to encourage behaviour change by making it “contagious” throughout groups and communities</li>
   <li><b>Reinforce norms if necessary</b> – Sometimes the norm will not be obvious to individuals. In this case, you may need several attempts to ensure that it is noticed and effective</li>
   <li><b>Take care when working with undesirable norms</b> – When an organisation focuses on negative behaviours from individuals, it can seem that they are the norm when in fact they are the exception.</li>

<h2>Defaults</h2>
<p>We like pre-set options so we can take the path of least resistance</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li>Make sure the default option <b>produces the maximum benefit for individuals</b></li>
   <li><b>There is always a default option</b> – often this means that without an active choice from an individual, they do not get the optimal choice.</li>

<h2>Salience</h2>
<p>We are influenced by whatever grabs our attention. We receive far too much information to process all of it fully, so we filter out sensory information as a coping strategy</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Our attention is most likely to be drawn</b> to novel stimuli (like bright pictures) that we can access (such as items at eye-level) and understand (perhaps through a simple slogan)</li>
   <li><b>Anchoring Bias</b> – The initial information we receive can often become salient in our future decisions</li>
   <li><b>The Saliency of Peak Experiences</b> – Peak experiences will stand out to us, and influence our memories of an event.</li>

<h2>Priming</h2>
<p>Subconscious cues can influence how we act</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Words</b> – When we are presented with certain words, this can influence our later behaviour. This can simply be reading the word, or being asked to memorise it or make a sentence using it</li>
   <li><b>Sights</b> – Healthy lifestyles can be primed in people by placing walking shoes in their environment (Wryobeck and Chen, 2003)</li>
   <li><b>Smells</b> – Researchers found that exposing people to the scent of an all-purpose cleaner caused a significant increase in the number of people who kept their table clean when eating.</li>

<ns-content class="grid-invert align-content sub-heading">
<h2>Affect</h2>
<p>Our emotions can heavily influence our actions</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Rapid and Automatic Effect</b> - Our emotions can strongly affect us as they are often rapid and automatic, meaning we can react to an event emotionally before we are aware of what we are reacting to</li>
   <li><b>Mood</b> – Our moods can influence our judgments, and can even work against our self-interest</li>
   <li><b>Presentation of Information</b> – Choice architects need to be careful when dealing with affect, as fear can be a powerful force, and is not useful unless it is combined with agency.</li>

<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>We like to be consistent in our behaviour, honouring our public promises, and engaging in reciprocity in our relationships</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Commitment Devices</b> – Making commitments can help us to avoid weaknesses of will in areas such as finances and health.</li>

<h2>Ego</h2>
<p>We like to feel positively about ourselves, and so will act in ways to support this goal</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Ego Bias</b> - When good things happen in our lives, we like to think that it is down to ourselves. However, when things go badly, we attribute it to other.</li>
