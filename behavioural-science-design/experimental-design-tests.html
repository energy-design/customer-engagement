<p class="p-feature">This is your guide on experimental design and the importance of testing behavioural designs to ensure their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="p-feature">The process involves <b>making observations, formulating hypotheses, designing and conducting experiments, analysing the data</b>, and <b>accepting or rejecting hypotheses</b>. This structured approach ensures the experiment is rigorous and produces robust results.</p>

<h2>Formulating Hypotheses</h2>
<p>A Research Hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon.</p>
<p>Experimental Design is about being able to accurately a hypothesis mathematically, with statistical analysis.</p>
<p>When designing an experiment, we always start by clarifying 2 things:</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li>The Research Hypothesis</li>
     <li>The Null Hypothesis</li>
  </ul> 
<p>First, we have to generate an observation that describes a pattern between two variables. When writing a research hypothesis, focus on the three rules - <b>give it direction, make it specific, and ensure it is testable</b>.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is a hypothesis which the researcher tries to reject. The 'null' often refers to the common or current view of something, while the research hypothesis is what the researcher really thinks is the cause of a phenomenon.</p>

  <p><b>The Null Hypothesis is easier to test because it’s easier to show that something’s false than demonstrate that it’s true.</b></p>
  <p>You can accept or reject a hypothesis but never truly prove it to be true.</p>

<h2>Defining the variables</h2>
<p>In an experiment, we deliberately change one or more variables to measure the effect that changes have on one or more outcomes.</p>
<p>The main variables are:</p>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
   <li><b>Independent Variable (The Cause)</b>: The condition that you change in an experiment. It is the variable you control.</li>
      <li><b>Dependent Variable (The Effect)</b>: The condition that you measure in an experiment.</li>
  </ul> 
<p>Confounding Variables are factors other than the Independent Variable that will affect the Dependent Variable. They will only influence one condition of the Independent Variable, and so will affect the outcome of the study. It’s important to identify and control confounding variables to ensure accurate results. </p>

<h3 slot="heading">A/B Testing</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>A/B testing is commonly used by businesses to optimise various campaigns, including search, web displays, direct mail, email, mobile, and social media. </p>
<p>It involves testing a single independent variable by comparing two versions (A and B) to assess their impact on a dependent variable. Version A typically represents the current version (control), while version B includes some modification (treatment).</p>
<p>It’s a good way to introduce the concept of optimisation through testing to a sceptical team, as it can quickly demonstrate the quantifiable impact of a simple design change.</p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard">
<h3 slot="heading">Multivariate Testing</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Multivariate testing (MVT) operates on the same principle as A/B testing but involves comparing a larger number of variables. It is particularly useful when examining multiple independent variables in relation to one or more dependent variables, and it relies on factorial design. The primary goal of MVT is to identify the optimal combination of variations from all possible options.</p>
<p>Factorial design plays a crucial role in structuring MVT experiments, as it helps define all the possible testing conditions. The most basic form of a factorial experiment is the 2x2 design, which involves two levels for each independent variable.</p>

<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard">
<h3 slot="heading">Independent Measures</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Each condition of the independent variable involves different participants. This is achieved through random allocation, ensuring each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any group. This design is also referred to as a "between-groups" design.</p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard">
<h3 slot="heading">Repeated Measures Design</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>A research method that involves testing the same subjects under two or more conditions to analyse if there is a statistically significant difference among groups. The same participants are involved in each condition of the independent variable. </p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard">
<h3 slot="heading">Randomised Control Trial</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>A Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) is the gold standard for determining whether a causal relationship exists between an intervention and its outcome. In an RCT, participants are randomly assigned to receive one of several interventions, typically medical treatments. The random allocation ensures that any potential differences between groups—whether known or unknown factors—are balanced, minimising bias.</p>
<p>RCTs are specifically designed to eliminate as many sources of bias as possible, making them highly reliable for assessing the effectiveness of interventions. While other experimental designs can identify associations between an intervention and an outcome, they cannot rule out the influence of third-party factors that may be responsible for the result.</p>
<p>Additionally, double-blinding (where both the doctors and patients are unaware of the treatment being administered) helps to prevent any preconceived notions or biases from influencing the outcomes of the trial.</p>
