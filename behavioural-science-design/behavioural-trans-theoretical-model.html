<h1 slot="heading"><span class="h1">Trans-Theoretical Model</span></h1>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Trans-Theoretical Model is an integrative, biopsychosocial model to conceptualise the process of intentional behaviour change. The model of was originally developed by Prochaska and DiClemente within a clinical context to describe the process of behaviour change for addictive behaviours.</p>
<p>The Trans-Theoretical model posits that health behaviour change  involves progress through <b>five stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action</b> and <b>maintenance</b>.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>People are required to move through the stages sequentially – meaning you can’t skip any stages</li>
    <li>Each of the stages have different ‘self-change strategies’ used to move between the stages</li>
    <li>The different stages have different beliefs</li>
    <li>Interventions to promote behaviour change should be tailored to a person’s current stage.</li>

<h3 slot="heading">Precontemplation</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>People in the Precontemplation stage do not intend to take action in the foreseeable future, usually measured as the next six months. Being uninformed or under informed about the consequences of one’s behaviour may cause a person to be in the Precontemplation stage.</p>
<p>Multiple unsuccessful attempts at change can lead to demoralisation about the ability to change. Precontemplators are often characterised in other theories as resistant, unmotivated, or unready for help.</p>
<p>The fact is, traditional programs were not ready for such individuals and were not designed to meet their needs.</p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard" decoration="bulb">
<h3 slot="heading">Contemplation</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Contemplation is the stage in which people intend to change in the next six months. They are more aware of the pros of changing, but are also acutely aware of the cons.</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis across 48 health risk behaviours, the pros and cons of changing were equal (Hall &amp; Rossi, 2008). This weighting between the costs and benefits of changing can produce profound ambivalence that can cause people to remain in this stage for long periods of time.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is often characterised as chronic contemplation or behavioural procrastination. Individuals in the Contemplation stage are not ready for traditional action-oriented programmes that expect participants to act immediately.</p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard" decoration="checklist">
<h3 slot="heading">Preparation</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Preparation is the stage in which people intend to take action in the immediate future, usually measured as the next month.</p>
<p>They have already taken some significant action in the past year. These individuals have a plan of action, such as joining a gym, consulting a counsellor, talking to their physician, or relying on a self-change approach.</p>
<p>These are the people who should be recruited for action-oriented programs.</p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard" decoration="circle-tick-blue">
<h3 slot="heading">Action</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Action is the stage in which people have made specific overt modifications in their lifestyles within the past six months. Because action is observable, the overall process of behaviour change often has been equated with action.</p>
<p>But in the Trans-Theoretical Model, Action is only one of five stages. Typically, not all modifications of behaviour count as Action in this Model.</p>
<p>In most applications, people have to attain a criterion that scientists and professionals agree is sufficient to reduce the risk of disease.</p>
</div>
</ns-card>
<ns-card role="listitem" type="standard" decoration="fix">
<h3 slot="heading">Maintenance</h3>
<div slot="paragraph">
<p>Maintenance is the stage in which people have made specific overt modifications in their lifestyles and are working to prevent relapse. They do not apply change processes as frequently as do people in Action. People are less tempted to relapse and grow increasingly more confident that they can continue their changes.</p>
<p>Based on self-efficacy data, researchers have estimated that Maintenance lasts from six months to about five years.</p>
<p>Longitudinal data (Surgeon General Report, 1990) supports this temporal estimate. After 12 months of continuous abstinence, 43% of individuals returned to regular smoking. It was not until 5 years of continuous abstinence that the risk for relapse dropped to 7% (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - USDHHS).</p>

<h2>The value of using this model</h2>
</ns-content>
<ns-column polofield="2" basketballcourt="2" rugbypitch="2" footballpitch="2" hockeypitch="2">
<ns-alert type="highlighter" state="success">
  <h2 slot="heading">Strengths</h2>
  <ul class="ul-ticked">
    <li>Movement between stages can be viewed as a sensitive measure of program outcome. Typically a good fit with addictive behaviours</li>
    <li>Offers a different focus of intervention at every stage; this should lead to more individually tailored interventions which are more likely to be successful than a “one size fit all” approach</li>
    <li>The model can be used for either adding (positive) or removing (negative) habitual behaviours</li>
  </ul>
</ns-alert>
<ns-alert>
  <h2 slot="heading">Limitations</h2>
  <ul class="ul-crossed">
    <li>It is unclear how the dividing lines for the stages are decided</li>
    <li>It neglects the role of reward/punishment and associative learning that is typically involved in habits that are hard to break</li>
    <li>If you are focusing solely on moving people from one stage to another, the model may result in effective interventions not being offered to people that would have responded</li>
    <li>Ignores influences from the external environment that change moment-by-moment</li>
